## üîê Authentication

This API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication with an additional OTP layer for sensitive operations.

### Login Flow

1. **Request Login**
   ```bash
   POST /api/Auth/login/request
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "email": "admin@cardealership.com",
     "password": "Admin@123"
   }
   ```

2. **Retrieve OTP**
   
   Check the console output where the API is running. You'll see:
   ```
   [OTP DELIVERY SIMULATION]
   To: admin@cardealership.com
   Purpose: Login
   OTP Code: 123456
   Valid for: 5 minutes
   ```

3. **Verify Login**
   ```bash
   POST /api/Auth/login/verify
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "email": "admin@cardealership.com",
     "otpCode": "123456"
   }
   ```

4. **Use Token**
   
   Include the received token in subsequent requests:
   ```bash
   Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   ```

### OTP-Protected Operations

The following operations require OTP verification:
- User registration
- User login
- Vehicle updates (Admin)
- Purchase requests (Customer)

**OTP Specifications:**
- **Length**: 6 digits
- **Validity**: 5 minutes
- **Usage**: Single-use only
- **Delivery**: Console output (simulated)

## üèóÔ∏è Design Decisions

### Architecture

**Clean Architecture Pattern**: The project follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Services**: Contain business logic
- **Models**: Define data structures
- **DTOs**: Transfer data between layers
- **Data**: Database context and access

### Security

1. **JWT Authentication**: Chosen for stateless authentication, scalability, and cross-platform compatibility
2. **OTP Verification**: Adds an extra security layer for sensitive operations
3. **Password Hashing**: SHA256 hashing for password storage (consider BCrypt for production)
4. **Role-Based Authorization**: Ensures users can only access permitted resources

### Database

**In-Memory Database**: Used for development and demonstration purposes
- **Pros**: Fast setup, no external dependencies, easy testing
- **Cons**: Data is lost on restart
- **Production**: Easily switchable to SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or MySQL

### OTP Delivery

**Console Simulation**: OTP codes are printed to console instead of sent via SMS/Email
- **Reason**: Simplifies development and avoids external service dependencies
- **Production**: Replace with actual SMS/Email service integration

### API Design

- **RESTful Principles**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **Consistent Responses**: Uniform error and success response formats
- **Filtering Support**: Query parameters for flexible data retrieval
- **Swagger Documentation**: Interactive API exploration and testing

## üß™ Testing

### Using Swagger UI

1. Start the application
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5050/swagger`
3. Click "Authorize" button
4. Login using the default credentials
5. Copy the received token
6. Paste in the authorization dialog with "Bearer " prefix
7. Try any endpoint!

### Using cURL

**Login:**
```bash
# Request login
curl -X POST http://localhost:5050/api/Auth/login/request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@cardealership.com","password":"Admin@123"}'

# Verify login (replace OTP)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5050/api/Auth/login/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@cardealership.com","otpCode":"123456"}'
```

**Get Vehicles:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5050/api/Vehicles \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

**Add Vehicle (Admin):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5050/api/Vehicles \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "make": "Tesla",
    "model": "Model 3",
    "year": 2024,
    "price": 45000,
    "color": "White",
    "mileage": 0,
    "vin": "TESLA123456",
    "description": "Brand new Tesla Model 3"
  }'
```

### Automated Testing Script

A test script is included in the repository:
```bash
chmod +x test_api.sh
./test_api.sh
```

## üîÑ Assumptions & Limitations

### Assumptions

1. **Purchase Flow**: Customer requests ‚Üí Admin approves/cancels
2. **No Payment Processing**: Payment integration is out of scope
3. **Single Currency**: All prices in USD
4. **VIN Uniqueness**: Each vehicle has a unique VIN
5. **Email Uniqueness**: Each user has a unique email
6. **Role Assignment**: User role is set during registration and cannot be changed

### Known Limitations

1. **In-Memory Database**: Data is lost on application restart
2. **No File Upload**: Cannot upload vehicle images
3. **Simulated OTP**: OTP is printed to console, not sent via SMS/Email
4. **No Pagination**: All results returned at once (suitable for small datasets)
5. **No Rate Limiting**: No protection against brute force attacks
6. **Single Instance**: Not designed for distributed deployment

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Persistent database (SQL Server/PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Real SMS/Email integration for OTP
- [ ] Image upload for vehicles
- [ ] Pagination and sorting
- [ ] Advanced search and filters
- [ ] Rate limiting and throttling
- [ ] Unit and integration tests
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Payment gateway integration
- [ ] Notification system
- [ ] Admin dashboard
